# DrowsinessDetection
Overview
---
A drowsiness detection model is a machine learning or computer vision system designed to identify signs of drowsiness or fatigue in individuals, primarily drivers, to prevent accidents. It monitors eye movements, blinking patterns, facial expressions, and head movements using real-time video input and possibly other sensors. By analyzing these indicators, the model can detect signs of fatigue, such as frequent blinking, long eye closures, yawning, or head nodding, and alert the individual to take a break before their drowsiness impairs their performance or leads to an accident.

Features
---
- Eye Tracking: Monitors eye movements, blinking frequency, and eyelid closure duration (PERCLOS) to assess drowsiness levels.
- Facial Expression Analysis: Detects changes in facial expressions, such as yawning, that indicate fatigue.
- Head Movement Monitoring: Tracks head position and movements to identify signs of nodding off or lowered alertness.
